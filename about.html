            Looking at a great painting, 
            it can be hard to remember that every artist was an 
            absolute beginner at some stage. 
            Everyone has to start somewhere, 
            and it's perfectly okay if you don't know 
            what kind of paint to use on your first canvas.
            I do different styles of drawing like:

            <!--https://www.theodysseyonline.com/10-reasons-traveling-everyones-favorite-hobby-->
            Some people would choose to spend their time and money on material possessions,
            such as a new car or a game console,rather than on a trip to a new place. Unfortunately,
              many don't realize just how rewarding and incredible 
              traveling can really be. Going to new places is beneficial
               in all aspects of one's life
             -- socially, intellectually and even emotionally. Each one of you should have traveling as a hobby because,
